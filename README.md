# electricsquid.github.io - Doing something different
This site is an experiment about not using a generic website interface. Instead opting for a window interface. Also to be used for housing random projects that I feel like adding to it, That may or may not have a useful purpose.

## How to use
I realized upon opening the website there isn't much instruction for what to do. Nor is there documentation about everything I've done. So here I'm going to explain some elements and what you can do with them

### Panel
The Panel, Dock, Taskbar, whatever you decide to call it is a small but neccessary part of interactinv with windows. Allowing you to Open, Toggle Visibility, and view status of all applications. With the large icons being application images and the smaller the status indicators. If you click the app icon it will open that applications window, and if you click it again it will toggle the visibility of the designated app.



## Features
1. A panel to open and toggle windows
2. A status indicator with the panel to show if a window is opened
3. A window that can be drug around to your desired location
4. A minimize button for the windows to hide it
5. A maximize button to expand the window to fill available space
6. A close button to remove an app from view and remove set it's status to inactive
7. Titles for each window to explain what is in the window
8. Auto sizing for each window based on the users resolution on page load
9. The ability to embed a website and youtube videos into a window using the 'Embed' app
