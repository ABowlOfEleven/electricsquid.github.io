# electricsquid.github.io - Doing something different
This site is an experiment about not using a generic website interface. Instead opting for a window interface. Also to be used for housing random projects that I feel like adding to it, That may or may not have a useful purpose.

# Use
If you are familiar with Linux or OSX you might recognize a few key elements of the site. It is largely based off the numix theme with a docky panel on xfce with linux.
### Panel
The panel comes with icons for each application, as well with status icons for each app. Showing if the app is currently open (Note: Closed, not minimized). With the larger being the application icon, and smaller the status.
